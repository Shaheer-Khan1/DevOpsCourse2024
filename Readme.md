## FitLife: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Istio Knowledge

This section showcases my practical knowledge of **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, and **Istio**—tools I have used to manage and deploy scalable, efficient, and secure applications in modern cloud environments.

### **Docker**
- **Overview**: Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Containers allow you to package applications with all of their dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Docker Images**: I know how to create and manage Docker images using `Dockerfile` and push them to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
  - **Docker Compose**: I have worked with Docker Compose to set up and manage multi-container applications.
  - **Docker Networking**: I understand container networking, including creating networks for communication between containers.
  - **Volume Management**: I have hands-on experience with Docker volumes for persistent data storage in containers.
- **Example Projects**: In my FitLife project, I have used Docker to containerize applications and services for deployment in isolated environments.

### **Kubernetes**
- **Overview**: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is the de facto standard for container orchestration.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Kubernetes Clusters**: I have hands-on experience in setting up and managing Kubernetes clusters, both locally (using Minikube) and on cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.
  - **Pods and Deployments**: I am proficient in creating, scaling, and managing pods and deployments, ensuring that applications run reliably in a Kubernetes environment.
  - **Services and Networking**: I understand how to expose applications using Kubernetes services, including LoadBalancer and ClusterIP types.
  - **Helm Charts**: I’ve worked with Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes, to deploy and manage complex applications in Kubernetes using reusable and configurable charts.
  - **Scaling and Autoscaling**: I have experience configuring Horizontal Pod Autoscalers to scale applications dynamically based on metrics like CPU or memory usage.
- **Example Projects**: In the FitLife project, I have utilized Kubernetes to orchestrate containerized services for high availability and scalability.

### **Terraform**
- **Overview**: Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows for the creation, modification, and versioning of infrastructure safely and efficiently.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Cloud Providers**: I have experience using Terraform with cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure to automate infrastructure provisioning.
  - **Terraform Modules**: I’ve written reusable Terraform modules for provisioning infrastructure components such as virtual machines, networking, storage, and security groups.
  - **State Management**: I understand the importance of maintaining state files in Terraform and how to manage state using remote backends like AWS S3.
  - **Version Control and Collaboration**: I use Git for version control, collaborating on Terraform configurations and managing infrastructure changes in a team environment.
- **Example Projects**: In this repository, I have used Terraform to automate the setup of cloud infrastructure, including VMs, networking, and security, in a scalable and repeatable way.

### **Istio**
- **Overview**: Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a way to control how microservices share data with one another. It provides advanced traffic management, security features, and observability.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Service Mesh**: I have worked with Istio to implement a service mesh that handles communication between microservices with fine-grained control over routing, retries, and failure handling.
  - **Traffic Management**: I am familiar with Istio’s ability to route traffic between services using virtual services and destination rules. This enables features like A/B testing, canary deployments, and blue/green deployments.
  - **Security**: I have used Istio to implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between services and manage fine-grained access policies with Istio’s authorization policies.
- **Example Projects**: I’ve implemented Istio in the FitLife project to manage microservices communication securely, with traffic routing and observability integrated into the Kubernetes environment.
